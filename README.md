# Personal_Frontend_Projects
This Repo contains a few things I have learnt over the past couple of months on my Journey to become a frontend developer
- From HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript
- All of the Different projects have their own branch

## 1. BASIC CALCULATOR APP
 - A working calculator App using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript 
 - The App only provides basic functionalities and not scientific 
 - It doesn't provide programmer or converter functionalities that helps change unit of measurements and currencies 
 - The App will have more functionalities from time to time as i get better at what i do.
 - The app was deployed using Netlify
 - The Link - [Calculator App](https://calculatorr-app.netlify.app/)
