# FrontEnd_practices
This Repo contains a few things I have learnt over the past couple of months on my Journey to become a frontend developer. . . 

## BASIC CALCULATOR APP
1. A working calculator App using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript 
    The App only provides basic functionalities and not scientific, programmer or converter functionalities that helps change unit of measurements and currencies 
    The App will have more functionalities from time to time as i get better at what i do.
